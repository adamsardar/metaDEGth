\title{Differential expression from RNAseq assay of OCT4(POU5F1) CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts in human zygote}
\format{
A data.table with 15,028 rows, documenting differential gene expression (logFC and unadjusted P-values) of 15,003 ENSEMBL gene entities in zygotes grown with and wihout the OCT4 transcription factor gene. Addition gene symbols, entrez gene IDs and uniprot annotations also included (duplicated ENSG entries result from many-to-one mappings)

\description{
GSE100118 is a CRISPR knockdown study of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 during human embryogenesis.
 
Generated 10 December 2019 from the trimmed reads associated with project on GEO. These were downloaded and aligned against the human genome using
Kallisto before transcript abundances were estimated using limma-voom. Finally, differential gene expression values were computed.
