This study continues on from GSE37699, which studies WZ4002 application to gefitinib insensitive cell lines. The authors have further expanded the study with a variety of PC9 derived cell lines:

PC9 : parental, unmodified cell line
PC9-GR2 : A gefitinib resistant cell line that took 6 weeks to develop resistance
PC9-GR3 : A gefitinib resistant cell line that took 24 weeks to develop resistance
PC9_GT : A gefitinib tolerant cell line
PC9_WT : A WZ4002 tolerant cell line
